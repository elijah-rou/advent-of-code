# Advent of Code

Central repository for all of my AoC code.
I started doing AoC to learn different languages, though in 2025 I might try for a leaderboard position with some gross looking code in a more competition-friendly lang.

## [2024 - OCaml](./2024_ocaml/)

Current Progress: Day 1

ML language time.

## [2023 - Zig](./2023_zig/)

My first "official" AoC! Current Progress: Day 16

Scratching my low-level itch with allocators, pointers and general memory funkiness in [Zig](ziglang.org), Blazingly-Fastâ„¢ :)

## [2022 - Elixir](./2022_elixir/)

Current Progress: Day 12

The BEAM is a great for distributed systems but Erlang is yuck so let's do some [Elixir](elixir-lang.org)!
