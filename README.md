# Advent of Code
Central repository for all of my AoC code.
I started using AoC to learn different languages, though from 2024 I might try for a leaderboard position!

## 2023
My first "official" year. 

Scratching my low-level itch with allocators and pointers in [Zig](2023/)

## 2022
Done retroactively. In progress.

The BEAM is a great tool to have in your arsenal for building distributed and concurrent systems, so naturally 
[Elixir](2022/) is the choice.

## 2021
TBD.

Language Candidate: OCaml

## 2020
TBD.

Language Candidate: Odin
