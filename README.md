# Advent of Code
Central repository for all of my AoC code.
I started doing AoC to learn different languages, though from 2024 I might try for a leaderboard position with some gross looking code in a more competition-friendly lang like Python, Clojure or Julia!

## [2023 - Zig]('2023%20-%20Zig/')
My first "official" year doing AoC.

Scratching my low-level itch with allocators, pointers and general memory funkiness in [Zig](ziglang.org). It's simple, fun and blazingly-fastâ„¢ :)

## [2022 - Elixir]("2022%20-%20Elixir/")
Done retroactively. In progress.

The Erlang virtual machine, BEAM, is a great tool to have in your arsenal for building distributed and concurrent systems (and even reactive web apps with [Phoenix](phoenixframework.org)), so naturally [Elixir](elixir-lang.org) is the choice.

## 2021 - TBD
Language Candidate: OCaml

## 2020 - TBD
